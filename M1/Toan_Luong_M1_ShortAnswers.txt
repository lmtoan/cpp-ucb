1. List at least five good reasons for using functions in code development.

- Reusability: different processes can reuse the same logic
- Improve readability: source code can be shorter and functions are defined in a different file
- Easier to test/debug: functions isolate the programs into separate logics so can investigate independently
- Allow for modular programming: different people can work on different functions or different versions of the same function
- Encapsulation: hide the impelemtation details to allow better abstraction

2. Why do we use function prototypes?

Because a function prototype:
- Tells What variable types are involvedW
- Describes what information sent to the function and what information got send back

3. What does the following statement do? using namespace std;

This directive will let the program to use all the "std" namespaces so it is no need to type "std:cout". Without the directive, the program
will look for "cout" and "cin" variables and throw Undefined errors

4. In C++, what is the maximum character length for variable names?

According to page 82 of C++ Primer, "C++ places no limits on the length of a name, and all characters in a name are significant.
However, some platforms might have their own length limits".

5. When possible, why is it preferred to use integer data types instead of floating point?

Integers might be preferred because of:
- Lower memory footprints
- "Richer" and more available types: long, short, etc
- Floats are slower and can lose precision
