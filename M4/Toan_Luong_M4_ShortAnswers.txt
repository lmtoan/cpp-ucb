1. What are the advantages of the new operator over the C library functions malloc, etc.?

- New operator can figure out how many bytes needed while malloc requires sizeof
- New operator can make a call to a Constructor
- New operator can be overloaded
- New operator will return a pointer to that memory block with that type, enable initializing the object while allocating memory

2. How do you know which constructor is the copy constructor?

Copy constructor can be used to copy an object to another object. It has the format Class_name(const Class_name &); and takes a constant reference to a class object as its argument. This constructor is invoked when performing object copying operations.

3. How are the copy constructor and the overloaded assignment operator different?

- Overloaded assignment operator is used when assigning 1 object to another. Copy constructor can initialize a new object, while operator only copies values.
- Objects initialized by copy constructor can have different memory locations. Variables assigned by operators will reference the same location
- Compiler will provide a copy constructor automatically, but will not overload assignment operator (just do a bitwise copy)

4. When does the copy constructor get used?

Useful for:
- Initialize an object from an existing object (as argument) and perform memberwise copying. Default copy constructor provides shallow copy
- Passing an object by value involves invoking a copy constructor

5. In the dynamic array example, we apply the subscript operator to something that isn't even an array. How is this possible?

It is possible by operator overloading declared in function int& DynamicIntArray::operator[]( long subscript ). The custom function will first verify if the subscript index i is valid and return a reference to the i-th element of the dynamically allocated memory if valid.
